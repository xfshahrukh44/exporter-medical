Actimove OA Knee Brace Universal  Left,Actimove OA Knee Brace  Universal  Left. Single upright hinged for 3 point leveraged compartmental pressure reduction. Lightweight and low-profile  the Actimove© OA Knee Brace Single Upright provides the perfect balance between structural correction and patient compliance.
