TheraTouch DX2 Shortwave Diathermy,Richmar TheraTouch DX2 Shortwave Diathermy. * Shortwave Diathermy with Scientific Dosage Control. TheraTouch DX2 introduces several new advancements in safety  convenience  and efficiency compared to other shortwave diathermy devices. The TheraTouch© DX2 diathermy is an electrotherapeutic modality offering continuous and pulsed mode to generate deep heat within body tissues for treating medical conditions such as muscle spasms  joing contractures  and general pain relief.  Scientific Dosage Control (SDC) allows for two additional dosimetry settings within Dose III provide more options for therapeutic heating within patient comfort tolerances.  DOSE I - Subthermal DOSE II - Mild Heat DOSE III - Low Heat DOSE III SDC M - Moderate Heat DOSE III SDC H - High Heat DOSE IV - Vigorous Heat  High Efficiency Auto-Tuning (H.E.A.T.) Resonant auto-tuning technology continually measures and adjusts to changes in the patient's impedance to provide maximum energy transmission  resulting in faster heating and shorter treatment times.

Polar Hear Rate Monitor FT60M Black w/White Display  Male,Automatic age-based target zone : bpm / % *  To help you train safely and effectively  the training computer determines your heart rate target zone limits automatically according to your age-based maximum heart rate (220 minus age). The limits are determined either in beats per minute (bpm)  as a percentage (%) of your maximum heart rate  or as a heart rate reserve (% HRR). See also Maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) and Manual target zone * Average and maximum heart rate of training * Heart rate : bpm / % * Heart rate is the measurement of the work your heart does. Heart rate can be expressed as the number of beats per minute or as percentage of your maximum heart rate. Heart rate can also be expressed as a percentage of your heart rate reserve  meaning the difference between your resting heart rate and maximum heart rate (HRR = HRmax - HRrest). In Polar software or during strength training  heart rate can be displayed as a graphical trend * HR-based target zones with visual and audible alarm * You can define your target zones for a training session based on heart rate to help define the right intensity. When you are out of the preset zones  the training computer will give a visual and audible alarm * HRmax (user set) * Manual target zone : bpm / % * This feature enables you to define the target zone as you want and is suitable for your training. You can set the target zone for your training as beats per minute (bpm)  as a percentage of your maximum heart rate  or as a percentage of your heart rate reserve (HRR%) * Polar Fitness Test:  Polar Fitness Test measures your aerobic fitness at rest in just five minutes. The result  Polar OwnIndex  evaluates your maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max). With the Polar Fitness Test you can measure your aerobic fitness by yourself  automatically and without any exertion. All you need is your training computer. The Polar Fitness Test is as accurate in predicting the VO2max as any sub maximal fitness test. The test is based on heart rate and heart rate variability at rest and personal information * Polar OwnCal©  calorie expenditure with fat percentage * Polar OwnCal calculates the number of kilocalories expended during training. This feature allows you to follow the kilocalories expended during one training session and cumulative kilocalories expended during several training sessions. Some Polar products also estimate the fat-burning percentage (fat% on display)  that is  kilocalories expended from fat during a workout which is expressed as a percentage of the total kilocalories burned. * Polar OwnCode© (5kHz) coded transmission *  Coded heart rate transmission automatically locks in a code to transmit your heart rate to the training computer. The training computer picks up your heart rate from your transmitter only.
