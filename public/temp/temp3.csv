Ultima OTC TENS Device Black,ELECTROTHERAPY RELIEF FOR CHRONIC OR ACUTE PAIN: Chronic or acute muscle and joint pain can really interfere with your daily life (or even worse  weekend fun!) but it can be hard to find the time or money to regularly go to the doctor or therapist?s office. Reusable medical electrodes can be used to directly target problem areas in order to treat arthritis-related pain  joint and muscle pain  and it even offers lower back pain relief?all at your own convenience * MUSCLE STIMULATOR TO TREAT PAIN: Your body is tough?it can work through pain and uses its many resources to heal itself. But we all know that sometimes it needs a little help. Through the use of the TENS unit electrodes  electrical pulses pass through the skin and stimulate the nerves in affected areas. It not only blocks pain signals from reaching your brain  but it triggers the release of endorphins?your body?s natural pain fighters * SAFE OVER THE COUNTER PAIN RELIEF: Electrostimulation might sound slightly frightening but be assured that it is a safe way to receive some much-needed pain relief * The Ultima OTC is sold without the need for a prescription * In fact  unlike addictive pain medications that can keep you dependent on them for relief  electrode stimulation is a non-addictive way to get treatment and help your body with its natural healing processes * CUSTOMIZABLE FOR YOUR SPECIFIC NEEDS: No two bodies are alike  and neither are their pain. The Ultima OTC TENS unit has 8 preset modes making it quick and easy for you to find the setting that is right for you. The intensity of the electrode stimulation can be easily adjusted to your comfort level  even in the middle of a treatment session. * STANDOUT FEATURES OF THE DEVICE: It's convenient to have a unit with professional quality medical electrodes  but it needs to be easy to use for the average person * Have no fear  the Ultima OTC has an easy to read backlit LCD screen that clearly shows text and body diagram * Pause and play buttons let you start and stop treatment as needed while the front closing door protects the controls  so you won't accidentally change the settings while you use the device * 1 Year Warranty * Comes with 2 AA batteries *,3200,31.98,58.14,Electrotherapy,Tens Units,0,4,3200.jpg,1848,0,0,0,3200.jpg,3200-1.jpg,3200-2.jpg,3200-3.jpg,3200-4.jpg,,,,,

Stethoscope  Black Edition Chestpeice Black Tube 27,The 3M? Littmann© Classic III? Stethoscope offers high acoustic sensitivity for exceptional performance when doing general physical assessments. It features dual tunable diaphragms and an updated design that is easier to clean and maintain. The 3M? Littmann© Classic III? Stethoscope is the latest version of the stethoscope that helps millions of medical professionals achieve their best. The Classic III stethoscope offers high acoustic sensitivity for exceptional performance  plus a versatile two-sided chestpiece with tunable diaphragms. The Classic III stethoscope is used by students and medical professionals alike to identify  listen to  and study heart  lung  and other body sounds for physical assessment  patient monitoring  and diagnosis.Tunable diaphragm technology?a 3M invention?lets clinicians hear different frequency sounds by simply adjusting the pressure on the chestpiece. Hold the chestpiece with light pressure to hear low frequency sounds; press a little more to hear higher frequency sounds. This time-saving feature allows the healthcare provider to focus on the patient  while the non-chill diaphragm provides patient comfort. Headset tension is easily adjusted for head size and comfort by squeezing together or pulling apart the eartubes. Snap-tight  soft-sealing eartips conform to individual ears for an excellent acoustic seal and comfortable fit. Eartips snap firmly onto the ends of the eartubes and  for safety  require a significant effort to remove. Resilient next-generation tubing retains its shape and flexibility even after folding tightly into a pocket. It provides longer stethoscope life due to improved resistance to skin oils and alcohol  and is less likely to pick up stains. Next-generation tubing is not made with natural rubber latex  a benefit to sensitive medical professionals and their patients. And  to play its part in the protection of human health and the environment  the next-generation tubing does not contain phthalate plasticizers. The Classic III stethoscope is made in the USA for consistent quality. It comes complete with large and small soft-sealing eartips  non-chill bell sleeve  and instructions.
